# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ :name => 'Chicago' }, { :name => 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(:name => 'Emanuel', :city => cities.first)
#
# loads environment-specific seeds. The assumed directory structure in db/ is like this:
#|___seeds
#| |___all.rb
#| |___development.rb
#| |___staging.rb
#| |___production.rb
#|___seeds.rb
#
['all', Rails.env].each do |seed|
