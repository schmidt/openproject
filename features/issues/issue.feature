  Background:
    Given there is 1 project with the following:
      | name        | parent      |
      | identifier  | parent      |
    And I am working in project "parent"

      | Bug  |     1    |
    And there is a default issuepriority with:

    And there is a role "member"
    And the role "member" may have the following rights:
      | view_work_packages |
      | edit_work_packages |
    And there is 1 user with the following:

      | subject     | issue1 |
      | type        | Bug    |
    And I am already logged in as "bob"

  Scenario: Navigating from issue reports back to issue overview
    When I go to the issues/report page of the project called "parent"
    And I follow "Issue" within "#main-menu"
    Then I should be on the issues index page of the project called "parent"

  Scenario: An issue attachment is listed
    Given the issue "issue1" has an attachment "logo.gif"
    When I go to the page for the issue "issue1"
    Then I should see "logo.gif" within ".icon-attachment"

  Scenario: Deleting an issue attachment is possible
    Given the issue "issue1" has an attachment "logo.gif"
    When I go to the page for the issue "issue1"
    Then I should see "logo.gif" within ".icon-attachment"
    When I click the first delete attachment link
    Then I should not see ".icon-attachment"
