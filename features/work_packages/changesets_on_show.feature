          | login | manager |

      And the project "ecookbook" has a repository
      And I am working in project "ecookbook"

      And the project uses the following modules:

      And the user "manager" is a "manager"

      And there are the following planning elements in project "ecookbook":
        | subject | start_date | due_date   |
        | pe1     | 2013-01-01 | 2013-12-31 |

        | revision | committer | committed_on | comments | commit_date |
        | 1        | manager   | 2013-02-01   | blubs    | 2013-02-01  |

      And I am already logged in as "manager"
