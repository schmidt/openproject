  Scenario: Updating the work package and seeing the results on the show page
    When I go to the edit page of the work package called "pe1"
    And I follow "More"
    And I fill in the following:
      | Type           | Phase2      |
    # This is to be removed once the bug
    # that clears the inserted/selected values
    # after a type refresh is fixed.
    And I wait for the AJAX requests to finish
