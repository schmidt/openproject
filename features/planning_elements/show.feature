  Background:
    Given there are the following types:
          | Name  | Is Milestone | In aggregation | Is default |
          | Phase | false        | true           | true       |

          | Name                  |
          | Standard Project      |

      And there is 1 user with:
          | login | manager |

      And there is a role "manager"
      And the role "manager" may have the following rights:

          | view_work_packages       |

      And there is a project named "ecookbook" of type "Standard Project"
      And I am working in project "ecookbook"

      And the project uses the following modules:
          | timelines |

      And the user "manager" is a "manager"

      And there are the following planning elements in project "ecookbook":
        | subject | start_date | due_date   |
        | pe1     | 2013-01-01 | 2013-12-31 |

      And I am already logged in as "manager"

  Scenario: Opening the planning element page and viewing the planning element
    When I go to the page of the planning element "pe1" of the project called "ecookbook"
    Then I should see "pe1"
